abstract = {The emergence and spread of antimicrobial-resistant (AMR) bacteria in natural environments is a major concern with serious implications for human and animal health. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of AMR Escherichia coli (E. coli) in wild birds and mammalian species. Thirty faecal samples were collected from each of the following wildlife species: herring gulls (Larus argentatus), black-headed gulls (Larus ridibundus), lesser black-back gulls (Larus fuscus), hybrid deer species (Cervus elaphus x Cervus nippon) and twenty-six from starlings (Sturnus vulgaris). A total of 115 E. coli isolates were isolated from 81 of 146 samples. Confirmed E. coli isolates were tested for their susceptibility to seven antimicrobial agents by disc diffusion. In total, 5.4% (8/146) of samples exhibited multidrug-resistant phenotypes. The phylogenetic group and AMR-encoding genes of all multidrug resistance isolates were determined by PCR. Tetracycline-, ampicillin- and streptomycin-resistant isolates were the most common resistant phenotypes. The following genes were identified in E. coli: blaTEM, strA, tet(A) and tet(B). Plasmids were identified in all samples that exhibited multidrug-resistant phenotypes. This study indicates that wild birds and mammals may function as important host reservoirs and potential vectors for the spread of resistant bacteria and genetic determinants of AMR.},

abstract = {Choosing an appropriate nest site is essential for successful breeding. Changes in land use cause populations of many species to decline although some species adapt to anthropogenic changes. The white stork Ciconia ciconia commonly uses artificial nest sites. Recently, white storks from Western Europe have been using landfills as feeding sites; the beginnings of this process are being observed in Central-Eastern Europe. The study aimed to determine factors influencing the probability of nest occupation and breeding effect in a Central-Eastern European population of white storks. We used long-term data from Western Poland on breeding effect, nest occupation, the structure supporting the nest, the proximity of the nearest landfills, landfill area, and land cover. The probability of nest occupation was significantly dependent on habitat quality (based on the share of the preferred type of land cover), the structure supporting the nest, and landfill proximity within a specific year. The breeding effect was influenced by habitat quality and nesting structure. We demonstrate that the type of nesting structure is an important factor influencing both the probability of nest reoccupation and breeding effect. However, the significance of landfills appears to be growing, and in recent years, storks prefer occupying nests closer to landfills, which may have significant consequences for the population of the white stork.},

abstract = {Dramatic population increases of the native white ibis in urban areas have resulted in their classification as a nuisance species. In response to community and industry complaints, land managers have attempted to deter the growing population by destroying ibis nests and eggs over the last twenty years. However, our understanding of ibis ecology is poor and a question of particular importance for management is whether ibis show sufficient site fidelity to justify site-level management of nuisance populations. Ibis in non-urban areas have been observed to be highly transient and capable of moving hundreds of kilometres. In urban areas the population has been observed to vary seasonally, but at some sites ibis are always observed and are thought to be behaving as residents. To measure the level of site fidelity, we colour banded 93 adult ibis at an urban park and conducted 3-day surveys each fortnight over one year, then each quarter over four years. From the quarterly data, the first year resighting rate was 89% for females (n = 59) and 76% for males (n = 34); this decreased to 41% of females and 21% of males in the fourth year. Ibis are known to be highly mobile, and 70% of females and 77% of males were observed at additional sites within the surrounding region (up to 50 km distant). Our results indicate that a large proportion of ibis have chosen residency over transience both within the study site and across the broader urban region. Consequently the establishment of refuge breeding habitat should be a priority localised management may be effective at particular sites, but it is likely to have an impact across the broader population. {\textcopyright} 2012 Martin et al.},

Most data on nesting behaviour comes from species that build a nest for each new breeding attempt, whereas almost nothing is known for nest reusers. Here, the association between nest size and nest building behaviour and occupation date and breeding success of the White Stork Ciconia ciconia, a migratory species with nest reuse, was studied. Large nests were occupied earlier and showed higher breeding success, even accounting for the confounding effect of the breeder age. In addition, nest size increased steadily over the entire breeding season and only ceased when reproduction failed. However, increase was not related to breeding success variables. Finally, nest size was related to the number of times that it was used in the past and thus, to the probability of successful reproduction. These results suggest that storks may seek and compete for bigger nests and that nest size could be an indicator of individual and/or nest-site quality.},

Hypothesis: Older siblings in better physical condition will produce more chicks as breeders. Time and location: A population of white storks nesting in the province of Madrid (central Spain) was monitored annually between 1999 and 2004. Methods: Hatching order, weight of hatchlings and nestlings, and date of return were recorded and correlated with subsequent fitness and measured as breeding outcome (binomial, failed or successful nests) and productivity (number of nestlings produced). Conclusions: Contrary to expectations based on their higher nestling weight, and to our hypothesis, first-hatched siblings returned later to the breeding grounds, were less successful, and produced fewer chicks than the rest of the brood. {\textcopyright} 2007 Jos{\'{e}} I.

Kidney samples from 35 guignas (Leopardus guigna), a wild felid from Chile, were investigated for paramyxoviruses using consensus-RT-PCR. In addition, thirteen serum samples of guignas were screened for the presence of FeMV-specific antibodies by an immunofluorescence assay (IFA). Viral RNA was detected in 31% of the kidney samples. Phylogenetic analyses revealed two well-supported clusters, related to isolates from domestic cats, rodents and bats. No significant histopathology changes were recorded in infected guignas. Serology identified two samples which were positive for FeMV-specific antibodies.

abstract = {Aims: Wildlife and humans compete for natural resources generating conflicts that sometimes translate into financial loss. In this study, the economical costs of the upkeep of a white stork Ciconia ciconia colony at a cattle farm over a six-year period were evaluated. Furthermore, the effect of ash lopping in nest site selection and the efficacy of nest removal in controlling the population of this species was analysed. Location: The ash dehesa studied was located in the Northern area of the Madrid province, in both Soto del Real and Manzanares el Real localities (40° 44' N, 3° 49' E), from 1999 to 2004. Methods: Estimation was made of the economical cost of white stork colony maintenance by estimating the total weight of branches and bud shoots on the ashes. The tree type (lopped or unlopped) was noted to determine nest site selection where new nests were established in the subsequent year after lopping. Finally, it was recorded if removed nests (by the Regional Government as a method of population control) were less like to rebuilt in function of previous breeding success (failed or not). Results: Storks mainly selected lopped trees as nest sites. To avoid the increase of white stork pairs in the colony, lopping was not carried out in subsequent years, causing economical losses to landowners (a minimum of 13,902.33 € in six years). In addition, due to the high nest-site fidelity in this species, the total number of nests in the colony was not reduced by nest removal. Nests that contained a pair that failed in their reproductive attempt were less likely to be rebuilt in the consecutive breeding season. The results showed that selective nest removal (removal of nests which failed the previous year) might be a more effective method for population control than nest removal methods used to date. Conclusions: Due to the low total economic cost of colony maintenance, it is proposed that economical compensation by the regional government to the farm owners will be a more effective management measure than nest removal.},

abstract = {Gulls (Larus spp.) have frequently been reported to carry Escherichia coli exhibiting antimicrobial resistance (AMR E. coli); however, the pathways governing the acquisition and dispersal of such bacteria are not well described. We equipped 17 landfill-foraging gulls with satellite transmitters and collected gull faecal samples longitudinally from four locations on the Kenai Peninsula, Alaska to assess: (a) gull attendance and transitions between sites, (b) spatiotemporal prevalence of faecally shed AMR E. coli, and (c) genomic relatedness of AMR E. coli isolates among sites. We also sampled Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) harvested as part of personal-use dipnet fisheries at two sites to assess potential contamination with AMR E. coli. Among our study sites, marked gulls most commonly occupied the lower Kenai River (61% of site locations) followed by the Soldotna landfill (11%), lower Kasilof River (5%) and upper Kenai River (<1%). Gulls primarily moved between the Soldotna landfill and the lower Kenai River (94% of transitions among sites), which were also the two locations with the highest prevalence of AMR E. coli. There was relatively high spatial and temporal variability in AMR E. coli prevalence in gull faeces and there was no evidence of contamination on salmon harvested in personal-use fisheries. We identified E. coli sequence types and AMR genes of clinical importance, with some isolates possessing genes associated with resistance to as many as eight antibiotic classes. Our findings suggest that gulls acquire AMR E. coli at habitats with anthropogenic inputs and subsequent movements may represent pathways through which AMR is dispersed.},

Even when pathogenic bacteria are the targets of antibiotics, hundreds of nonpathogenic bacterial species are affected as well. Therefore, both pathogenic and nonpathogenic bacteria have gradually become resistant to antibiotics. We tested whether there is still cooccurrence of resistance and virulence determinants. We performed a comparative study of environmental and human gut metagenomes from different individuals and from distinct human populations across the world. We found a great diversity of antibiotic resistance determinants (AR diversity [ARd]) and virulence factors (VF diversity [VFd]) in metagenomes. Importantly there is a correlation between ARd and VFd, even after correcting for protein family richness. In the human gut, there are less ARd and VFd than in more diversified environments, and yet correlations between the ARd and VFd are stronger. They can vary from very high in Malawi, where antibiotic consumption is unattended, to nonexistent in the uncontacted Amerindian population. We conclude that there is cooccurrence of resistance and virulence determinants in human gut microbiomes, suggesting a possible coselective mechanism.},

Seabirds may act as sentinels of natural and anthropogenic changes in the marine ecosystem health, including pollution by antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs). We used real time PCR to identify and quantify 22 plasmid-mediated ARGs in the gastrointestinal microbiome of six wild seabird species, comparing an anthropized (Fernando de Noronha Archipelago - FNA) and a pristine biotope (Rocas Atoll - ROA), Brazil. Of 257 birds, 218 (84.8%) were positive to at least one ARG. ARG classes encoding resistance to tetracyclines (75.1%), quinolones (10.5%) and phenicols (10.5%) were the most prevalent, with tetracyclines significantly greater than the remaining classes (p < 0.05). Genes tet(S) (29.2%), tet(A) (28.8%), and tet(B) (24.9%) were the most commonly found and had a significantly greater prevalence when compared to the remaining ARGs (p < 0.05). The anthropized biotope presented statistically significant higher prevalence of sulfonamide- and quinolone-encoding ARGs in comparison with the pristine (respectively, p = 0.01 and p = 0.03), and higher sulII gene prevalence (p = 0.04), consistent with anthropogenic pressure. Migratory species (only present in ROA) showed statistically significant higher mcr-1 (polymyxins) and blaTEM (betalactam) prevalences (respectively, p = 0.009 and p = 0.02), and mcr-1 percentage load (p = 0.0079) in comparison with non-migratory. To our knowledge, this is the largest ARGs survey based on direct detection and quantification in seabirds worldwide, and the first to evaluate non-synanthropic species in oceanic islands. This is the first detection of mcr-1 in wild free-ranging seabirds in Brazil and in free-ranging migratory non-synanthropic seabirds worldwide. Our findings show the importance of biological and ecological factors, highlighting the role of seabirds as anthropization sentinels and ARGs-pollution environmental indicators (even in a pristine biotope), and their involvement in the One Health epidemiological chain of ARGs.},

abstract = {Assessing diet composition of White Storks (Ciconia ciconia) breeding under North African conditions provides key information to understanding its trophic niche for conservation purpose. Since, climate controls productivities of foraging habitats and thus food availability for predators, this study examines how Storks' diet parameters varied following a climate gradient along with rural-to-urban landscapes in north-eastern Algeria. Feeding strategies to cope with severe conditions were discussed in light of climate aridity and urbanization and how these influence reproduction, population dynamics and distribution. While invertebrate prey accounted for 94 % of ingested individuals, the biomass intake was dominated by chicken remains scavenged from rubbish dumps (67 %) and small mammals (14 %). Generalized linear models revealed that prey numbers varied significantly between climatic regions and landscapes types, but no significant differences were observed for other dietary parameters, including prey biomass. The study showed high dietary similarity between study climates and landscapes, mainly among rural and urban colonies located in semi-arid and sub-humid areas, which differed from those in suburban and arid climate. Rarefaction and extrapolation curves indicated that prey species richness in White Stork diets was expected to be higher in urban colonies located in sub-humid climate. Despite low prey species diversity in arid regions, the White Stork demonstrates a broad trophic niche, which could be due to supplementary feeding from human refuse. This study suggests that regardless of the climate or landscape, White Storks ensure a constant food intake, despite prey biomass fluctuations, by adapting their diet. Foraging in diverse habitats, including trash dumps, ensures a sufficiently balanced diet to meet nutritional requirements.},

Most human salmonellosis cases are foodborne, but each year infections are also acquired through direct or indirect animal contact in homes, veterinary clinics, zoological gardens, farm environments or other public, professional or private settings. Clinically affected animals may exhibit a higher prevalence of shedding than apparently healthy animals, but both can shed Salmonella over long periods of time. In addition, environmental contamination and indirect transmission through contaminated food and water may complicate control efforts. The public health risk varies by animal species, age group, husbandry practice and health status, and certain human subpopulations are at a heightened risk of infection due to biological or behavioral risk factors. Some serotypes such as Salmonella Dublin are adapted to individual host species, while others, for instance Salmonella Typhimurium, readily infect a broad range of host species, but the potential implications for human health are currently unclear. Basic hygiene practices and the implementation of scientifically based management strategies can efficiently mitigate the risks associated with animal contacts. However, the general public is frequently unaware of the specific disease risks involved, and high-risk behaviors are common. Here we describe the epidemiology and serotype distribution of Salmonella in a variety of host species. In addition, we review our current understanding of the public health risks associated with different types of contacts between humans and animals in public, professional or private settings, and, where appropriate, discuss potential risk mitigation strategies.},

Because of their ubiquitous presence, despite the regulatory measures established in the Stockholm convention that lead to the ban of some of them, the study of contamination in different levels of the food web becomes necessary in order to gain a more solid knowledge about their chemical fate and their influence on the ecosystems. In the field of wildlife toxicology, a wide variety of species has been proposed as bioindicators, or sentinels of environmental health. The species used should provide an "early warning system" for toxic contaminants in the environment, and top predators represent the most suitable species.

abstract = {The poultry industry in the European Union produces 13 million tons of manure annually, which represents a major health and environmental challenge. Composting is an environmental-friendly technique for the management of manure, but there are few studies about antibiotic residues and antimicrobial resistances at a field scale. The goal of this study was to determine if the composting of poultry manure at a field scale would result in the reduction of antibiotic residues, pathogenic bacteria, and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in the final fertilizer product. A 10-week composting of poultry manure spiked with enrofloxacin, doxycycline, and ciprofloxacin was performed. The determination of antibiotics residues and 22 selected ARGs was carried out together with the identification of bacteria by metagenomics. In the case of ciprofloxacin and doxycycline, a 90% decrease was observed after composting for 3 weeks. Sixteen ARGs were detected at the beginning of the experiment; 12 of them decreased from week 0 to week 10 (reduction of 73.7–99.99%). The presence of potentially pathogenic bacteria, such as, Campylobacter coli or commensal bacteria such as Escherichia coli decreases along the composting process. In conclusion, 10-week composting of poultry manure promotes the reduction of antibiotic residues and most of the ARGs and pathogenic bacteria.},

abstract = {European white stork (Ciconia ciconia) populations have been object to several conservation measures such as reintroduction programs, habitat improvement or supplementary feeding in the last decades. Although recent white stork censuses revealed an upward trend of most of the western populations, evaluations of the relative importance of certain conservation measures are still scarce or even lacking. In our study we analyzed the effect of supplementary feeding on the reproductive success of white storks in conjunction with other factors such as weather or nest site characteristics. We present data of 569 breeding events at 80 different nest sites located in variable distances to an artificial feeding site at Affenberg Salem (south-western Germany) collected from 1990-2012. A multilevel Poisson regression revealed that in our study population (1) reproductive success was negatively affected by monthly precipitation in April, May and June, (2) pairs breeding on power poles had a lower reproductive success than pairs breeding on platforms or trees and (3) reproductive success was significantly higher in pairs breeding in close distance to the feeding site. The number of fledglings per nest decreased by 8% per kilometer distance to the feeding site. Our data suggest that supplementary feeding increases fledgling populations which may be a tool to attenuate population losses caused by factors such as habitat deterioration or unfavorable conditions in wintering habitats. {\textcopyright} 2014 Hilgartner et al.},

abstract = { Between 1999 and 2010, an annual census of the White Stork Ciconia ciconia breeding population was carried out in Slovenia using standardised methods. The Stork's population was concentrated in the NE and SE parts of Slovenia. In the 1999-2010 period, the breeding range of its population in Slovenia expanded in NW direction (the Savska ravan region), in SW direction (the Notranjsko podolje and Piv{\v{s}}ko podolje regions), but the species also colonized a part between Central and SE Slovenia (Dolenjsko podolje). Between 193 and 240 pairs were breeding during the study period, 209 pairs on average (HPa). The largest number of breeding pairs was recorded in 2004, the smallest in 2005. During the study period, breeding pairs (HPa) occupied 350 discrete nests in total. Average number of breeding pairs that raised juveniles (HPm) was 161. The highest fecundity was recorded in 2004, when 534 juveniles (JZG) fledged, the lowest in 2006, with only 219 fledged juveniles. On average, 414 juveniles fledged per year. The breeding pairs' (JZa) average breeding success in these 12 years was 2.02, the highest in 2000 (2.41), the lowest in 2006 (1.09). Average breeding success for the successful breeding pairs (JZm) was 2.57. The highest was in 2007 (2.94), the lowest in 2006 (2.07). The largest number of breeding pairs in 2004 and 2008 can be explained by the favourable fecundity in the population in 2000 and 2004, as juveniles become sexually mature at the age of 3-5 years, and at that age they generally return to the breeding grounds for the first time. The lowest number of breeding pairs and poor breeding success in 2005 and 2006 was caused by late arrival of White Storks to the breeding grounds and by unfavourable weather conditions during the breeding period. The pattern of nests placement did not change generally during the last 12 years. The largest proportion of nests was positioned on various kinds of poles (81%) and on chimneys (18%). In total, 27 area surveyors and 239 assistants helped in census realisation. },

We studied the relationship between arrival date and breeding success of individuals in a central Iberian population of white stork Ciconia ciconia, between 1999 and 2005, and the ways in which other potential factors, such as age or sex, affect this relationship. Our results showed that age was the factor most closely related to arrival date and breeding success. Older individuals returned earlier to the breeding grounds, achieved larger clutch sizes and produced more chicks than younger birds. After controlling statistically for age effect, breeding probability (laid eggs or not) and laying date were still significantly explained by arrival date. A higher probability of failure to reproduce (no eggs laid) was found in birds arriving later than in those arriving early. However, clutch size and nestling success (number of nestlings in the nest 40 days after hatching) were not correlated with arrival date. Food availability in the study area throughout the breeding cycle, due to a nearby rubbish dump, could be the factor mitigating differences in clutch size and nestling success related to individual arrival date.},

Infections caused by resistant bacteria lead to up to two-fold higher rates of adverse outcomes compared with similar infections caused by susceptible strains. These adverse outcomes may be clinical or economic and reflect primarily the failure or delay of antibiotic treatment. The magnitude of these adverse outcomes will be more pronounced as disease severity, strain virulence, or host vulnerability increases. The negative impacts of antibacterial resistance can be measured at the patient level by increased morbidity and mortality, at the healthcare level by increased resource utilization, higher costs and reduced hospital activity and at the society level by antibiotic treatment guidelines favouring increasingly broad-spectrum empiric therapy. In this review we will discuss the negative impact of antibiotic resistance on patients, the healthcare system and society.},

abstract = {Periodic censuses have been widely used to identify the population numbers and conservation status of many bird species. In order to be comparable, a census must be homogeneous through time. However, this requirement is not always possible. For this reason, studies addressing a possible bias in sampling efforts are very useful to correct such errors. In the present work, a standardized periodic monitoring of breeding White stork (Ciconia ciconia) at six Spanish colonies was conducted to estimate survey accuracy. We estimated the percentage of breeding pairs and productivity (number of chicks), i.e., accuracy, detected in each possible combination of number of visits as compared with the results obtained for the whole intensive monitoring, i.e., reality. Our results showed that single visits resulted in lower percentages of the number of breeding pairs and productivity detected compared with combinations of two or more visits. Nevertheless, one visit in a single month (April for the number of breeding pairs and June for productivity) did not show significantly lower results than the rest of the combinations of two or more visits. Early or late visits in the season might underestimate breeders by not accounting for either late-occupied or failed nests, respectively. In addition, the obvious increase in the probability of detection related with the number and the size of chicks is probably the reason why later visits in the season reported the highest value of productivity. In conclusion, the estimation bias presented in this study may be used to adjust sampling efforts in the census of the White stork. {\textcopyright} Dt. Ornithologen-Gesellschaft e.V. 2008.},

abstract = {Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is considered an emerging public health problem. Greater AMR development rate is associated with “antibiotic-using” environments. Wildlife thriving in anthropized landscapes could be good indicators of the burden of AMR and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in these areas. The aim of this study was to determine the presence and load of ARGs in fecal swabs of wild Andean foxes (Lycalopex culpaeus) from anthropized landscapes of central Chile. DNA was extracted from samples of 72 foxes; 22 ARGs encoding resistance against 8 antibiotic groups were evaluated using qPCR. Eighteen of the 22 ARGs were found and tet(Q) (65.3%; 15/72 of the samples) was the most common gene detected. Almost half of the foxes presented a ‘multiresistant microbiome' (i.e. at least three ARG encoding resistance to different groups of antimicrobials). Prevalence of tet(Q) was higher in the cold-humid season than in the warm-dry season, but not for other genes. Up to 15 and 13 ARGs were detected in the fecal samples from two additional foxes that were kept 6 and 11 days, respectively, in a clinical environment (Wildlife Rescue Center) and received antibiotic treatment. Some of the ARGs detected (e.g. mecA and blaCTX-M) in the present study are of particular concern from the public health perspective. Wild foxes seem to be good sentinels for ARG environmental burden in highly anthropized environments of central Chile.},

Between 2011 and 2014, we sampled white storks from colonies exposed to different degrees of anthropic pressure across the major areas of natural distribution of white storks in Spain. Cloacal swab samples (n = 467) were obtained from individuals belonging to 12 different colonies from six different regions. Additionally, 70 samples were collected from recently deposited droppings at the base of nesting platforms. We phenotypically characterized E. coli isolates, confirmed presence of CR genes and classified plasmids. Risk factors for acquiring these genes were assessed. Overall, 8.8% (41 out of 467) storks carried CR E. coli in their cloaca and five (7.1%) were identified from recently deposited droppings; therefore, 46 isolates were further characterized. Of them, 20 contained blaCTX–M–1, nine blaCMY–2, six blaCTX–M–14, four blaSHV–12, three blaCTX–M–15, two blaCTX–M–32, one blaCTX–M–1 together with blaCMY–2, and one blaCTX–M–1 together with blaSHV–12. All were multidrug-resistant, and four harbored the plasmid-mediated colistin resistance mcr-1 gene. CR genes were associated with the presence of IncI1, IncFIB, and IncN replicon families. XbaI-macrorestriction analysis revealed a great diversity among most of the XbaI-PFGE types, but indistinguishable types were also seen with isolates obtained from different locations. Clonal complex 10 was the most common among CR E. coli and two blaCTX–M–15 positive isolates were identified as B2-ST131. Carriage of CR E. coli was significantly higher in colonies located close to solid urban waste disposal sites in which foraging on human waste was more likely and in one case to cattle grazing. The co-occurrence of blaCMY–2 and mcr-1 on plasmids of E. coli isolated from wild birds as early as 2011 is of note, as the earliest previous report of mcr-1 in wild birds is from 2016. Our study shows that foraging at landfills and in association with cattle grazing are important risk factors for the acquisition of CR E. coli in white storks.},

While it is increasingly hypothesized that wildlife could play an important role in antimicrobial-resistant bacteria dynamics, empirical data remain scarce. The present work builds on a systematic review of the available data in order to highlight the main information we have and to suggest research pathways that should be followed if we aim to fill the gaps in our current knowledge. To achieve this goal, we address four questions: (i) Which resistant bacteria are the most frequently observed in wildlife? (ii) How are resistant bacteria exchanged between wildlife and the other hosts involved? (iii) In which habitats are those resistant bacteria found? (iv) Are resistances associated with certain ecological traits of the host? Synthesis and applications. We highlight the strong link existing between the impact of human activities on natural habitats and the carriage of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria by wildlife. Furthermore, we underline that omnivorous, anthropophilic and carnivorous species are at high risk of being carriers and potentially spreaders of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria. Identifying among those groups key sentinel species may be of particular interest to implement ecosystem contamination surveillance. Finally, we discuss possible exchange routes for antimicrobial-resistant bacteria between humans and wildlife. Considering that water is of major importance in those exchanges, a critical way to control antimicrobial resistance spread may be to limit aquatic environment contamination by antimicrobial-resistant bacteria and antibiotics.

Wildlife play a fundamental role as sentinels, reservoirs and potential vectors of ARGs. For the first time in Galapagos, we have identified and quantified the presence of ARGs in free-living giant tortoises (Chelonoidis porteri). We performed ARG analyses by quantitative PCR of faeces collected from the cloaca of 30 tortoises widely distributed across Santa Cruz Island. Validated samples (n = 28) were analysed by a panel of up to 21 different ARGs and all 28 tortoise samples were positive to one or more genes encoding resistance. Thirteen of 21 tested ARGs were present in at least one sample, and 10 tortoises (35.7%) had a multi-resistant pattern. We recommend additional research so we may more fully understand resistance patterns across taxa and geographical locations throughout the Galapagos archipelago, and the implications of ARGs for the health of wildlife, domestic animals, and humans. In this study, we found 100% of sampled giant tortoises had ARGs present in their faeces, suggesting a large-scale distribution of these genes within the archipelago.},

There were significant differences between species (respectively, kelp gull and Magellanic penguin): ARGs occurrence (blaTEM [p = 0.032]; tetM [p = 0.015]; tetA [p = 0.003]; and sulII [p = 0.007]), mean number of ARGs per sample (p = 0.031), ARGs mean load percentage (aadA [p = 0.045], tetA [p = 0.031], tetM [p = 0.016], blaTEM [p = 0.032], sulII [p = 0.008]), percentage of genes conferring resistance to an antimicrobial class (betalactams [p = 0.036] and sulfonamides [p = 0.033]), mean number of genes conferring resistance to one or more antimicrobial classes (p = 0.024]), percentage of multiresistant microbiomes (p = 0.032), and clustering (p = 0.006). These differences are likely due to these species' contrasting biology and ecology - key factors in the epidemiology of ARGs in seabirds. Additionally, this is the first report of mecA in seabirds in the Americas. Further studies are necessary to clarify the occurrence and diversity of ARGs in seabirds, and their role as potential sources of infection and dispersal within the One Health chain of ARGs.},

abstract = {Over the past decades wildlife has received much attention as good indicator of ecosystems health. Due to the widespread distribution of some xenoestrogens such as organochlorines, there is a need for screening and risk evaluation of these endocrine disrupters in living organisms from the global point of view of ecosystems health. Depending on the ecosystem under study, different species are selected for the purpose of evaluating levels, trends, behaviour and fate of chemicals in a selected environment. Different studies have used birds as bioindicators of environmental contamination. Trophic level plays an important role when a bird species is selected as “environmental indicator”. Consequently, top predators are more exposed to bioaccumulative contaminants resulting in higher concentrations and more impact. Kubiak et al. showed that birds may suffer significant effects on reproductive success due to organochlorines, not only in hatching success, but also in chick status. White Stork (Ciconia ciconia) is a colonial species that feeds mainly on wildlife preys; however recently rubbish dumps have become an important source of nutrients. They may also be exposed to contamination via dietary intake of contaminated species through the food web. Females can transfer contaminants stored in their body fat into their eggs. Similarly, contaminant levels in White Stork nestlings are entirely dependent on their parents' diet, indicating the presence of contaminants within the local environment of the colony. The main goal of this research programme was to establish an integrated evaluation of contamination in White Stork through the region of Madrid (Central Spain). For this purpose White Stork has been monitored for the last four years. Since eggs are known to reflect the accumulation of lipophilic contaminants in birds, the study focused on the usage of failed eggs obtained from White Storks which represent a good measure of the body burden in the laying hen. In addition, samples from nestlings from the same nests as failed eggs were also obtained to evaluate the transfer and bioaccumulation of selected organochlorine compounds in the species. In this study the preliminary results obtained from monitoring of organochlorine compounds in laying hens and their nestlings sampled from different colonies with know feeding strategies are presented.},

Because a possible effect of this on the thermoregulation of the chicks was suspected, we selected nests with a brood size of two to carry out several experiments. First, we compared the body temperature of an individually isolated chick with one that remained in the nest. The isolated chick was kept in a wooden cage near the nest tree. After a 20-minute period, the nestling that remained unbrooded in the nest showed a higher body temperature than its sibling. Secondly, we noted that when fresh dung was removed from some of the nests, body temperature dropped more quickly than those from unmanipulated nests used as a control. We conclude that the microclimate of the nest influences nestling thermoregulation. This may help to advance their age of effective endothermy. {\textcopyright} 1999 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract = {In the mid 1970s, the breeding populations of the migrant White Stork Ciconia ciconia were close to extinction in the northeastern region of France (Alsace). A re-introduction project was implemented, resulting in the year-round settlement of some individuals in the region, which rely on additional food supplied by humans during the winter. Today, both resident and migrant birds breed in the same areas and take food from rubbish dumps and humans (farmers). The effects of these anthropogenic influences, altering Stork behaviour, on Stork reproductive success are not known. The aim of this study was to test the influence of bird status (resident vs. migrant) and food availability (control nests vs. nests that benefit from high food supply) on reproductive success. In control nests, the mean laying date was earlier in resident than in migrant White Storks. There was also a clear seasonal decline in clutch size. For all nests, the numbers of eggs and hatchlings were higher in resident birds than in migrants, which can be attributed to the earlier breeding of resident Storks. The large broods of resident birds showed a high mortality rate, leading to the same fledgling success (fledglings/hatchlings) and number of fledglings as in migrants. Fledgling success and the number of fledglings were higher for nests close to a reliable food supply. In summary, although resident birds can breed earlier and produce more eggs than migrants, we found no advantage in terms of number of fledglings. The higher mortality rate of chicks found in pairs with a large brood could be caused by the deterioration of their habitat. Thus, the year-round settlement of Storks may not present a biological advantage if the quality of their habitat is not guaranteed by the conservation of their grasslands. {\textcopyright} 2006 The Authors.},

abstract = {In contrast to the attention attracted by temporal trends of phenology, the spatial patterns of arrivals, departures or stays of trans-Saharan birds are still nowadays largely unknown in most of their European breeding areas. In the case of the white stork (Ciconia ciconia), some studies have attempted to describe its migratory patterns throughout some European countries but, to our knowledge, no one has related these patterns to some kind of explanatory variable which offers an ecologically-based explanation for the heterogeneous phenology observable among populations. Here, arrivals, departures and stays of this species, recorded in hundreds of Spanish localities, were related to a set of environmental, geographical, biological and spatial predictors, and modeled by multiple regression. The best model for arrival dates accounted for up to 34% of variability of data and pointed towards an earlier arrival in those populations located in south-western Iberia and with higher population densities. This last relationship is probably due to the competition for nest-site fidelity maintenance. However, no variable was able to explain properly the blurred spatial pattern recorded for departure dates. Departure decisions are strongly influenced by social behavior in this species and depend on collective decisions influenced by peculiar local environmental conditions of each year rather than macrogeographical gradients. Environmental, geographical or spatial variables also did not capture much of the observed variability in the length of the stays among populations. However, this variable was strongly related to the arrival and departure dates of populations. White storks stay longer in localities with earlier arrivals and, especially, later departures. {\textcopyright} Dt. Ornithologen-Gesellschaft e.V. 2007.},

We studied the relationship between breeding success and nest fidelity in the White Stork Ciconia ciconia. We also studied how other factors such as age, sex, habitat, colony size and productivity in previous breeding attempts might interfere with this relationship. Our results showed that pairs with higher fidelity rates also have lower failure rates, and that breeding failure and productivity in the previous season influenced the frequency of nest change in the following season. In addition, a curvilinear relationship was found between age and nest fidelity. These results suggest that age is a major factor related to nest fidelity and therefore individual experience could explain this behaviour in the White Stork. Changing the nest involves a reproductive cost for which nest fidelity can be considered as an adaptive strategy to increase fitness. {\textcopyright} 2006 The Authors.},

abstract = {Intra-brood food distribution in altricial birds can strongly affect nestling competitive hierarchies and subsequent brood reduction. Food allocation patterns result from scramble competitions among the nestlings, various forms of parental favoritism, and/or agonistic interactions among nestlings. Food allocation is related to agonistic interactions among nestlings or to parental favouritism in non-aggressive species. Since white stork chicks are not aggressive and they do not receive direct feeding, parental infanticide has been proposed as an alternative mechanism to control brood reduction. The capacity of white stork parents to control food allocation was examined. We hypothesized that parents favour the senior chick by adjusting prey size to suit its ingestion capacity. We experimentally manipulated (Spain 1996 and Algeria 2004) nestling size by exchanging the senior chick for a larger one. After the exchange parents delivered longer and heavier prey items and they increased the total food amount delivered to the brood, which benefited not only the senior chick but also its smaller nestmate. We also discuss the effect of environmental conditions over brood reduction by comparing chick mortality, intrabrood weight asymmetries and fledging success in years with above (2003 and 2004) and below (2002) average rainfall in the area. We conclude that parents may control intra-brood food distribution which enables them to invest more in larger sibs but not (under favourable conditions) at the expense of junior chicks. {\textcopyright} 2008 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract = {During the last decades, landfills have become a valuable food source for wildlife, being in some cases determinants of large avian population increases. Superabundant food resources at landfills can increase reproductive and/or survival parameters; however, negative effects such as intoxication, plastic ingestion, skeletal deformities, unbalanced oxidative stress, and other health problems have also been reported. White stork (Ciconia ciconia) commonly benefits from landfill resources. Here, we evaluate potential landfill effects on demographic parameters (reproduction and offspring survival) at the individual level in a single population. Our results show that a more intense use of landfills by breeders has a positive effect on hatching success but a negative effect on juvenile survival probability after emancipation, at least during the first year of life. High amount of food and proximity to landfill may explain their beneficial effect on reproductive parameters. On the other hand, poor quality food, pollutants, and pathogens acquired during early development from a diet based on refuse may be responsible for reduced future survival probability. Consequently, both positive and negative effects were detected, being foraging at landfills at low to medium levels the better strategy. Although our study shows that intense foraging on rubbish can imply both costs and benefits at an individual level, the benefits of superabundant food provisioning observed at population level by other studies cannot be ignored. Management actions should be designed to improve natural food resources, reduce non-natural mortality and/or human disturbances to guarantee the species viability under current European Union regulations designed to ban open-air landfills in a near future.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully.

The aim of this study was to determine the presence or absence of nine resistance genes (blaTEM, catI, mecA, qnrS, sulI, sulII, tet(A), tet(Q), vanA) in the faeces of 141 pigeons from four urban parks in Alajuela, Guadalupe, Tres R{\'{i}}os and San Jos{\'{e}} in Costa Rica. The genes were identified by real-time PCR directly from enema samples. About 30% of the samples were positive for genes catI and sulI; between 13% and 17% were positive for qnrS, sulII, tet(A) and tet(Q); and 4% were positive for blaTEM. The mecA and vanA genes were not detected. The average of antimicrobial resistance genes detected per pigeon was 2. Eight different patterns of resistance were identified, without differences in the sampling areas, being the most common pattern 2 (sulII positive samples). During rainy season, the genes more frequently found were sulI and tet(A). In conclusion, the urban inhabiting pigeons tested are currently carrying antimicrobial resistance genes, potentially acting as reservoirs of resistant bacteria and vectors to humans. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first study carried out on direct detection of resistance genes in the digestive metagenomes of pigeons.},

abstract = {Given the significant spatial and temporal heterogeneity in antimicrobial resistance distribution and the factors that affect its evolution, dissemination, and persistence, it is important to highlight that antimicrobial resistance must be viewed as an ecological problem. Monitoring the resistance prevalence of indicator bacteria such as Escherichia coli and enterococci in wild animals makes it possible to show that wildlife has the potential to serve as an environmental reservoir and melting pot of bacterial resistance. These researchers address the issue of antimicrobial-resistant microorganism proliferation in the environment and the related potential human health and environmental impact. {\textcopyright} 2014 Radhouani, Silva, Poeta, Torres, Correia and Igrejas.},

@article{Dolejska2018,
abstract = {Multidrug resistant (MDR) Gram-negative bacteria have been increasingly reported in humans, companion animals and farm animals. The growing trend of plasmid-mediated resistance to antimicrobial classes of critical importance is attributed to the emergence of epidemic plasmids, rapidly disseminating resistance genes among the members of Enterobacteriaceae family. The use of antibiotics to treat humans and animals has had a significant impact on the environment and on wild animals living and feeding in human-influenced habitats. Wildlife can acquire MDR bacteria selected in hospitals, community or livestock from diverse sources, including wastewater, sewage systems, landfills, farm facilities or agriculture fields. Therefore, wild animals are considered indicators of environmental pollution by antibiotic resistant bacteria, but they can also act as reservoirs and vectors spreading antibiotic resistance across the globe. The level of resistance and reported plasmid-mediated resistance mechanisms observed in bacteria of wildlife origin seem to correlate well with the situation described in humans and domestic animals. Additionaly, the identification of epidemic plasmids in samples from different human, animal and wildlife sources underlines the role of horizontal gene transfer in the dissemination of resistance genes. The present review focuses on reports of plasmid-mediated resistance to critically important antimicrobial classes such as broad-spectrum beta-lactams and colistin in Enterobacteriaceae isolates from samples of wildlife origin. The role of plasmids in the dissemination of ESBL-, AmpC- and carbapenemase-encoding genes as well as plasmid-mediated colistin resistance determinants in wildlife are discussed, and their similarities to plasmids previously identified in samples of human clinical or livestock origin are highlighted. Furthermore, we present features of completely sequenced plasmids reported from wildlife Enterobacteriaceae isolates, with special focus on genes that could be associated with the plasticity and stable maintenance of these molecules in antibiotic-free environments.},
