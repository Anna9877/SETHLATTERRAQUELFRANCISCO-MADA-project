# This folder contains both the code for data exploration and mixed-effects model fitting of the cleaned data.

There is a Quarto file which does some exploratory data analysis by creating a few tables and figures named 'Data_Exploratory_Analysis.qmd".

There is a second Quarto file with model fitting and performance testing named 'StatisticalAnalysis_ModelFitting.qmd".
