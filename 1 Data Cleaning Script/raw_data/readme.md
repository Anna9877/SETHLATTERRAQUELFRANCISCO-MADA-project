# CODEBOOK 
## This folder contains a simple made-up data-set in an Excel file.

It contains the variables:

'cisa' = Individual Lab Identification of Sample

`yr` = year sample was collected 

'id' = Field Sample Unique Identification

'nes' = Nest Identification

'samp' = Breeding Period during which sample was collected. (1 = adult sample when eggs were being incubated, 2 = chick sample when chick was 0 to 14 days of age, 3 = chick sample from 15 days to fledging (~55days))

'ad' = adult bird identifyer ("_" dictates 2 identfied adults in one nest)

'age = average age of the adults

'fledged' = number of chicks that successfully left the nest (ie matured)

'hatched' = number of chicks that successfully emerged from eggs

'eggs' = number of eggs laid

'nsuccess' = basica meteric of reproductive success (#fledged/#eggs)

'mean_lui' = the average landfill use index of individual birds during the breeding season (~April to August) = # of times bird was sighted at Landfill/ # of times landfill was visited by research during the season)

'TET..B,	TET..Y,	TET..K,	TET..M,	TET..Q,	TET..S,	TET..W,	sulI,	sulII,	str,	aadA,	catI,	catII,	ermB,	ermF,	qnrB,	blaTEM,	qnrS,	mecA,	mcr.1' = Individual resistence genes associated with unquie antibiotic classes

'TET' = representative of tetracycline class (includes TET..B,	TET..Y,	TET..K,	TET..M,	TET..Q,	TET..S,	TET..W)

'SULF' = representative of Sulfonimides (includes sulI,	sulII)

'AMIN' = representative of the aminoglycosides (includes str,	aadA)

'PHEN' = representative of phenicols (includes catI,	catII)

'MACR' = representative of macrolides (includes	ermB,	ermF)

'BLACT' = representative of beta-lactam (includes blaTEM, mecA)

'QUIN' = representative of quinolones (includes qnrB, qnrS)

'POLIMYX' = representative of polymixins (includes mcr.1)

The dataset prior to cleaning and establishment of class buren and multi-drug (>3 class) resistence.
